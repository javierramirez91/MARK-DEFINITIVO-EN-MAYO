## How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is designed to provide comprehensive information about the Mark Assistant system for developers, administrators, and users. Each section focuses on a specific aspect of the system and can be read independently, though we recommend starting with the Project Overview to get a general understanding of the system.

For developers who will be working on the system, the Installation and Setup, API Documentation, and Customization Guide sections will be most relevant. For administrators who will be managing the system, the Admin Panel Guide, Security Guide, and Troubleshooting Guide will be most useful.
